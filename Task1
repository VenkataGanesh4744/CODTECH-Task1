BLINK AN LED

// Define the pin for the LED
const int ledPin = 13; // LED connected to digital pin 13

// Define the interval (in milliseconds)
const long interval = 1000; // 1 second

// Variables to track timing
unsigned long previousMillis = 0; // Stores the last time the LED was updated

void setup() {
  // Set the LED pin as an output
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
}

  // Get the current time
  unsigned long currentMillis = millis();

  // Check if it's time to toggle the LED
  if (currentMillis - previousMillis >= interval) {
