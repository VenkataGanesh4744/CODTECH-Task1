**OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT**
**Project: Arduino project to blink an LED**

**Overview of the Arduino LED Blinking Project**
**Objective:**
This project aims to introduce basic embedded programming concepts and hardware interfacing by making an LED blink at a specific interval using an Arduino board.

**Components:**

1.Arduino Board: Any Arduino board like Uno, Mega, Nano, etc.
2.LED: A light-emitting diode to indicate the blinking.
3.Resistor: Typically a 220Î© resistor to limit the current to the LED.
4.Breadboard and Jumper Wires: For making connections.

**Concepts Covered:**

1.Digital I/O: Understanding how to configure and use digital input and output pins.
2.Timing Functions: Using the millis() function to manage timing without blocking the main program loop.
3.State Management: Managing the state of the LED (on/off) and timing intervals.

**Steps:**

1.Hardware Setup:

-->Connect the longer leg (anode) of the LED to digital pin 13 on the Arduino.
-->Connect the shorter leg (cathode) of the LED to one end of a resistor.
-->Connect the other end of the resistor to the ground (GND) pin on the Arduino.

2.Software Setup:

-->Write the Arduino code to blink the LED at a specified interval.
-->Upload the code to the Arduino using the Arduino IDE.

**Detailed Steps:**

1.Hardware Connection:

-->Place the LED and the resistor on the breadboard.
-->Connect the anode (long leg) of the LED to digital pin 13 of the Arduino.
-->Connect the cathode (short leg) of the LED to one terminal of the resistor.
-->Connect the other terminal of the resistor to the GND pin of the Arduino.

**Code Explanation:**

-->Setup: In the setup() function, configure pin 13 as an output using pinMode().
-->Loop: In the loop() function, use the millis() function to get the current time. Check if the specified interval has passed. If yes, toggle the LED state using digitalWrite() and update the last toggled time.

**Upload and Test:**

-->Connect the Arduino to your computer via USB.
-->Open the Arduino IDE, paste the code, select the correct board and port, and upload the code.
-->Observe the LED blinking at the specified interval.

**Educational Value:**

-->Basic Programming: Learn how to write and structure simple Arduino programs.
-->Timing and Control: Understand how to control the timing of actions in an embedded system.
-->Digital Electronics: Learn how to interface with basic electronic components like LEDs and resistors.

This project serves as a foundation for more complex projects involving sensors, actuators, and advanced control systems. It provides a hands-on experience with the fundamental concepts of embedded systems and microcontroller programming.
